# JavaScript - Objects

Object is a collection of named values.

Objects will have properties and methods.

Except primitive values, almost everything in JavaScript is objects.

We can also make primitive values as object using `new` keyword.

* Create an Object:
    ```javascript
    const nameOfObject = {key: value}
    ```
