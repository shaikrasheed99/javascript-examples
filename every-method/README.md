# JavaScript - Every method

Every method is used to check for all the elements of arrays, objects are satisfying input condition.

If the applied condition is satisfied by all the elements, then it will return `true` or else `false`.

    ```javascript
    const isAllElmentsArePositive = Array.every((element) => {
        return // condition
    });
    ```
