# JavaScript - Variables

Three ways to define variables in JavaScript. 

1. `let`
    * can be declared only once.
    * can be defined multiple times.

    ```javascript
    let firstName = "Ironman";
    ```

    * `NOTE:` camel case is used for `let` variable names. 

2. `const`
    * can be declared and defined only once.
    * values of these variables are immutable where we cannot change them again. 

    ```javascript
    const PI = 3.14;
    ```

    * `NOTE:` upparcase is used for `const` variable names.

3. `var`
    * can be declared and defined multiple times.

    ```javascript
    var age = 123;
    ```
    
    * `NOTE:` camel case is used for `var` variable names.
