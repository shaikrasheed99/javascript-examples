# JavaScript - If else block

If else blocks are used for the conditional checkers.

First condition would be placed in `if` block, statements would be executed if that block is true.

If not, the control would be moved to the `else` block.

* `if-else` ladder.
    ```javascript
    if (condition) {
        //statement
    } else if(condition) {
        //statement
    } else if(condition) {
        //statement
    } else {
        //statement
    }
    ```
