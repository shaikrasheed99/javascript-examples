# JavaScript - Primitive & Reference types

* Primitive type values:
    The values are directly stored in the `stack` along with the name as reference.
    * `string`
    * `number`
    * `boolean`
    * `null`
    * `undefined`
    * `symbol`
    * `bigint`

* Reference type values:
    The values are stored in `heap` first, then reference of the heap along with the variable name would be stored in `stack`. 
    * `Objects`
    * `Arrays`
    * `Functions`
    * `Dates`
    * `Times` etc..
